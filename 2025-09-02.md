# God is a blackhole

I started writing this journal about 8 minutes ago, and so that's 2:28 PM.

Obviously there's some irony in the fact that I said that yet my day has been full of "distractions".

But look at the nature of those distractions. Some of them are actually very intellectually rewarding, and even my exposure to lectures do last for a good span of time and help me build up my mental models. The lectures themselves my not have had a super high attention resolutions, but I am certain (given that I've been doing this for years) that it has helped me improve my overall knowledge.

On the other hand I do have a few minutes of distracted / less productive attention, and some of them were just fun (like watching the John Mayer concert).

Realistically though, I don't know if I can say that I've directed my attention to these activities. Rather these activities surged naturally, entropically, randomly, and I attended to them – I reacted to them.

This is the one activity that I've done that feels more generated as an output of my own conscious production.

But if I were to calculate the net expected value in my life quality of the non-self-propelled, and the self-propelled actions, I'd say that still I have had a net positive. I wouldn't be deriving these findings if it wasn't for the fact that I've spent these many hours actually diving on these topics. Yet these attention-usage actions have been traded against other actions, like working on shorter-term.

How does this compare against others's lifestyles? Well, i haven't mentioned the use of short-term content throughout, because I have purposefully not engaged with it. Which has helped me to have more introspective time, which actually may yield better outcomes for me, like this conversation I'm sure will have.

The question that it poses is that of balancing through conscious and unconscious attention spends. This is an information problem, which is also a physics problem. My intuition tells me that attention must be embedded in the same rules of physics, and therefore it should be bounded to entropy like any other physical phenomena.

If that is the case, then consciously directing attention must be antientropic by nature, and therefore it must trade something that outputs more entropy in return. This goes to the nature of consciousness, and the nature of attention.

I can derive logically that attention must happen with the brain, as attention can be completely messed up by disrupting normal brain function – yet so can you do so with consciousness.

To this I go back to my latest psychodelic experience (me eating a 350mg marihuana cookie that led to a bad trip that was slightly good).

In the moment that I convinced my emotions to let go, and particularly through the whole experience, I was perfectly conscious. What was not ok was the nature of my reality. This constrast was very obvious when I kissed my girlfriend, and I finally let go completely of my fear. Where I had an almost spiritual encounter with something rather deep. I was, then again, conscious. My attention was in another realm that I haven't had explored until that moment.

So I can argue, at least from my own experience, that my attention is mediated by my brain, and that my consciousness is this other something that I don't quite understand, but is definitely more fundamental than attention is.

Given that consciousness is fundamentally my unknown, the blackbox, yet I can see from its outputs that is always present so long as I am alive, it is attention the only 'variable' I can really play with, given that it "streams" experience to consciousness.

So I believe, somehow, I have to adapt my brain to be capable of self-directing attention more often. I guess this is concentration. I have to train myself to concentrate, to focus. The more I can focus, the better I'll be at directing my attention.

By definition though, I can't always focus – because always focusing would be extremely energy intensive. Therefore I have to make it such that my environment is design for the non-focused time to be directed towards meaningful actions, such that activities happen at the "sub-attention" level (what people may call subconscious), such that the energy expenditure of this activities is low, but the net reward is high.

Therefore what I draw from this learning is that I need to train myself to concentrate by whatever medium possible, because being very skilled at that may convert into higher sub-attentional learning bandwidth, which may convert into higher life quality.

In turn, I'd be able to absorb mode from less and live a happier life.

Ok so here is I map I drew from how I'm visualizing these ideas mentally.

Reality "spreads" waves of information which are captured by our perception (mediated via our sensory channels), which then gets filtered and decoded by our brain, these filtered perceptions then pass through an attention block (if available) which then also filters the information stream into our consciousness.

What I am not so sure of is how this works backwards. Whether consciousness can imprint backwards orders via the attention block, which then converts into output that goes out as waves into reality.

I do not recall in my experience that I (consciousness) told myself to actually release during my psychedelic experience. It was as chaotic as everything else, and it happened spontaneously as an output of the interaction.

During the kiss, a self-reinforcing echoing thought permeated the motion, and it was correlated to "Gravity" the song that was playing at that exact moment. The thought was "Let go, Let go, Let go", and it was only the emotional safety of the moment what allowed the rest of me to let go. I was just basically riding the whole experience, with no output. Just like an observer watching a movie play out.

Hmm... So this "modular" aspect does seem to correlate logically to what the neocortex does. It can modulate action, but it can't really bypass more neurologically meaningful areas like the limbic system or the brain stem. That doesn't describe the nature of consciousness, but rather the nature of the channel through which consciousness is capped to. It can only modulate because of the topography of its connection with reality, and if information can indeed flow back and forth, it can't really flow "forth" if this output channel consciousness -> attention -> brain is fundamentally disrupted by anything that disturbs the normal functionality of all the downstream mechanisms. Hence why social media addiction can basically hijack you while being completely conscious and helpless that it is doing so. It is likely that helplessness what leads to depression, as somewhere somehow the conscious info does permeate to the brain.

I'd argue then that whatever consciousness is has to live in a scope of reality that is not comprehensive through the lens of what reality is based on what's filtered from what our perceptions are capable of filtering in.

Consciousness may live in another "universe" so to say, in another dimension, and the boundary of my consciousness and other consciousness may rely on this little stream that connects that universe with this one.

During my psychedelic experience, I could in some way sense (as consciousness) a vastness that was not limited to what was being streamed through my brain. Particularly when I closed my eyes i could perceive that there was more than just the stream of data flowing to my consciousness.

But I wonder if the intuition I have of the nature of consciousness holds up.

Consciousness may have more in common with a blackhole than anything else. That really resonated with me.

But WHY did it resonate? What the hell is intuition? I am currently very much in a high-bandwidth connection with my conscious experience. I am living this conversation through because most of this is completely cognitive work. All my other bodily features, like hearing noises or even observing the letters being written are secondary. Yet... It somehow feels right? As if consciousness were streaming back outputs, not only of words that emerge here, but also as cues that tell my limbic system "this is correct". Why does it do it? Why is my intuition so capable? How is it that it is so good at directing me?

If consciousness lives at the other side of the singularity, where this reality we see and perceive with mathematics and physics no longer makes sense, maybe it is the ultimate antientropic process, the ultimate place where actually entropy flows backwards – well that would make a lot more sense.

If consciousness is all wisdom, if it is the ultimate wisdom (as it is ultimately all high signal information concentrated) and our brains looking BACK at it can only see a small glimpse of what it is, and our "understanding" is embedded not in consciousness itself but rather in the brain, if understanding is an ever evolving emotion, a state of awareness, understanding basically reconfigures your pathways to allow to have a better map of the territory of consciousness.

Ok let's think about the nature of black holes for a second. In order for you to have a black hole you need an extremely high density of mass, so much mass so that information can flow in, but it can't flow out.

If consciousness is indeed the ultimately negentropy of information, then instead of mass we may be dealing with another form of energy.

Let's see, for consciousness to arise, we need brains. Brains are neural networks, which are very high dimensional webs of information flow living in a limited band of compute. It runs with electricity. When I see through my cat's eye, I see a more primitive form of consciousness. My cat sees me, and it recognizes me, and it understands at the very least that I am this sort of something living with it. It loves me, and it expects me.

Through the cat's biology I represent protection, and I represent goodness for its own survival. I am therefore helpful to its evolution.

Yet my cat's neural network is smaller than mine, and therefore incapable of higher degrees of meta cognition. It just can handle less information than mine can handle at once.

But where does information flows to ultimately? We process inputs through an algorithm (we don't know where the algorithm goes to) and then the algorithm responds back with outputs.

If there is indeed a higher dimension where consciousness fundamentally lies that is the territory of consciousness, which is not necessarily expansive in my model but actually a single point where all the information is concentrated, that's where all information comes from naturally. The way that this information is arranged is NOT random, it is determined. The way that this information flows out is, therefore, not random either.

So fundamentally in the highest dimension possible, there's this boundary of the sphere of all information. That boundary IS consciousness.
