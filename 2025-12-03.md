I'm perfectly fine with existence, but I am also ready to die.

What do you mean you're ready to die?

Literally, give the event of a crash that ends my life. 

Let that happen if it needs to.

Why would it matter if I have lived anyways. Whether it's now, or 40 years, or 100 years in the future.

Eventually I found the monad, and if I die I'd be even closer to it.

These are just different flavors of the same soup – and I think they are all welcome.

For example I can be tasting the flavor of wealth and be good at once. I mean, fantastic. Let it come. Let me see Dalma smile, let me greet the wilderness in a random country.

Or let me taste the flavor of poverty and suffering, and let me see how the heck I am going to get myself to understand it.

Take out all of my limbs, and my senses. Take out everything that I so much appreciate right now - and I'm still going to be fine. 

I am still going to find my way back.

I am still going to find harmony. Harmony is the meaning of my life, and that I can find anywhere.

Why choose life then, over not having it?

I don't get to choose it. That's the point. I am not in control of how long it takes, and the myriad of events that have to happen to keep it where it is.

Yet I get to have it.

How about I appreciate the fact that it's a gift, and that it doesn't get to be mine?

There's harmony in acceptance. That is, full acceptance of temporary light also is full acceptance of eternal darkness.

Therefore when seeing life as it is (temporary) rather than as I wish it would be (eternal), I can appreciate it.

And I can sit on it, and contemplate the world.

And feel bored...

And get to build, create, exist.

For as long as I am allowed to.
