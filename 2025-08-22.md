# Survival of the fitest

I am really curious about how these game theoretical scenarios we play as a species keep yielding inequaltiy as an output.

Yet, why is this inequality a bad thing in and of itself? If in nature, it is rational to see gaussian distributions for almost any population, and almost for any sort of behavior.

It seems like nature always tends to approximate inequality as a natural evolutive progression.

As soon as societies bounced off colectivism, and individualism took on, these game theoretical scenarios gave rise to a more unequally distributed society.

But whas is there to do with that, right? Other than signal the central bank overloads and scream treason. There's obviously trust built into the system that probably is not benefitting us all in a way that is emotionally sound.

Clearly there's enough food production to feed humanity, yet there is not food in your stomach at 9:00PM if you don't have money to afford it. I mean, I've clearly lived through that.

But I also happen to have gone out of that places, and beaten other peers to market using better heuristics than they did – that's nature, isn't it? Was I not encoded with more advantageous biological traits that made me better suit? I can clearly see that in my school peers. I am not morally nor technically superior than them by any logical means, but I am pragmatically superior to them when it comes to the efficient use of those opportunities at my disposal to leverage myself into a better(ish) economical position.

Am I evil, then? Very odd.

If I am _not_ evil, and animals are _not_ either, then why is it that is morally wrong for inequality to surge? Particularly, what can we do about it given the rise of cheap labor? Are there not my Maracay peers bound to a sure demise once the robots come to take them out. Who's going to bouch for their ignorance? Aren't they merely just low-level animals in the eye of the more powered? Just like chimpansees in a zoo. We don't want to necessarily keep them all around.

Is that cruel, or is that natural? I am very curious.

What is true is that if we follow incentives from their source to their destination, and if society doesn't change significantly anytime soon (which logically doesn't make a ton of sense given that we're already in a tit-for-tat spyral), seems plausible to argue that only the strong will survive – regardless of AGI.
