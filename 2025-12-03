I'm perfectly fine with existence, but I am also ready to die.

What do you mean you're ready to die?

Literally, give the event of a crash that ends my life. 

Let that happen if it needs to.

Why would it matter if I have lived anyways. Whether it's now, or 40 years, or 100 years in the future.

Eventually I found the monad, and if I die I'd be even closer to it.

These are just different flavors of the same soup – and I think they are all welcome.

For example I can be tasting the flavor of wealth and be good at once. I mean, fantastic. Let it come. Let me see Dalma smile, let me greet the wilderness in a random country.

Or let me taste the flavor of poverty and suffering, and let me see how the heck I am going to get myself to understand it.

Take out all of my limbs, and my senses. Take out everything that I so much appreciate right now - and I'm still going to be fine. 

I am still going to find my way back.

I am still going to find harmony. Harmony is the meaning of my life, and that I can find anywhere.
